# Changelog
All notable changes to BlackBox are written down in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Several BlackBox windows at once: the new-window button at the top, or Ctrl+Shift+N, opens
  another window with a chat and an agent of its own, a step down and to the right of the first.
  The windows take turns with the mouse and keyboard, stay out of each other's screenshots, all
  pause while you type in any of them, and one Pause/Break stops them all. A chat open in one
  window brings that window forward when picked in another's History.
- Filmmaking: a window that lays a film out on one timeline (its characters and places, its shots
  and its sound) and makes it shot by shot with ComfyUI. Say in words what to make or change, for
  one piece or the whole film, and BlackBox writes the prompts, picks the models, makes it and looks
  at it; earlier takes are kept. Or ask for a film in the chat.
- Films get songs about a minute long (the best of three, judged by SongEval), spoken lines in one
  cloned voice with lip sync, and fresh looks at every shot, cut and the whole film that catch
  broken bodies, frozen or jumping action, a camera that moves when it shouldn't and a change of
  style, and make the pieces again.
- Measured movement in short clips (which way the camera and what is in the picture moved, and how
  far) for every look the agent takes at a video.
- A guide to writing video prompts that LTX follows, given with LTX workflows, and a first frame
  made by an image model for every video.
- Look-ups: BlackBox searches the web for the questions and doubts the model has about how
  something is done and for the errors programs raise, and puts what it found under the step; ten
  minutes or eight tries with nothing looked up make it time to look.
- Claude through Anthropic's own API: type `api.anthropic.com` (or just `claude`) and an API key.
  Prompt caching, thinking kept between steps, Claude Opus 5.5 unless another is picked, with its
  whole 1M context on Auto.
- An effort dropdown next to the model, medium unless picked, for models whose server says they
  take one.
- Messages sent while BlackBox works wait above the box until the model reads them: × takes one
  back, and **Interrupt the model** (or Ctrl+Enter) has it read at once.
- A full-screen viewer for the pictures and videos in the chat and in Filmmaking, with the others
  an arrow key away. Videos in the chat play by themselves, muted, while they are on screen.
- **Prompt** under a picture made with ComfyUI or AUTOMATIC1111 shows the prompts and settings it
  was made with, read back from the file.
- Links in the chat open in the browser.
- The window's title names its chat.
- A sysadmin benchmark ticket that moves a live game API's database from SQLite to PostgreSQL while
  players keep writing to it.
- This changelog.

### Changed
- The context slider goes up to 1M.
- A click away from a piece in Filmmaking, or Esc, goes back to the whole film.

### Fixed
- A click of the agent's that lands on the Filmmaking window or a dialog of BlackBox's goes to what
  is behind it, as one on the chat window always did; keys meant for another program no longer
  land in them.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-10-19
The first release.

### Added
- A single portable `BlackBox.exe` that installs nothing and keeps its settings, chats and
  downloads in a `Data` folder next to it.
- Desktop control: the model sees the screen and uses the mouse and keyboard in any program, on
  every monitor. Every click is aimed by a fresh look at the screen, a click that changed nothing is
  said so, and models that point on a 0-1000 grid (Qwen3 and later, Gemma 4) use it.
- Clicks with keys held, held keys, drags, scrolling, sequences of key presses and waiting for the
  screen to change.
- Any OpenAI-compatible model server: LM Studio, llama.cpp, Ollama, vLLM, OpenRouter and other
  online APIs. BlackBox picks the strongest model the server offers by its agent benchmark score,
  and starts on Kilo's free models, which need no account or key.
- The server, API key, model and context size in the bar at the top, with how full the context is.
- Long jobs: the context starts afresh with a handoff note when it fills, dropped requests are sent
  again, and a server that can't be reached or fails is waited for.
- Pause/Break stops BlackBox from any window, Continue carries on after a stop, and messages typed
  while it works correct it; it holds off the mouse and keyboard while you type.
- A log of the agent's inputs in a corner of the screen, left out of its screenshots.
- History: every chat is saved from its first message and can be carried on. Replies are shown as
  Markdown, and every line says when it happened and how long it took.
- Files and screenshots dropped on the window or pasted with Ctrl+V go with a message;
  right-click → Copy on a picture in the chat.
- Documents: reading and writing Word, Excel, PowerPoint and PDF files without Office.
- Pictures, video, sound and 3D models with ComfyUI, using the one on the PC or installing it,
  finding and downloading models with their makers' settings, and previews in the chat.
- Servers over SSH: the ssh tool, copying files both ways, and checks of the config files it writes.
- Web search and page reading, portable helper programs fetched for files nothing on the PC opens,
  and reminders that pop up.
- MCP servers in Settings, and the agent setting up the ones a job needs.
- Chatting for you in chat apps, saying it's an assistant when asked.
- "Ask me first" in Settings for approving each step, and a crash log.
- A command-line runner, and benchmarks: desktop tasks, 2048 and Unity 2048, clicks, a sysadmin
  lab, a chat stand-in lab and ComfyUI requests.
